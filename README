The factory application in the Piramida 2000 smart metering system by this company: http://www.sicon.ru/about_company/ 
has a few drawbacks. One of them is a poor performance when the database size excedes some 30 Gb.
I have to admit that our company didn't purchase the updates for several years due to financial shortage, so maybe they 
have fixed this issue by now. But still, the default app is quite inconvenient, so I replaced it with another one.
As a temporary solution I developed an app in Microsoft Excel which did a great job, but had some issues itself.
So now it's time to develop a real XML Import application, which is what this project is.
It's main purpose is to pick xml files from a disignated folder one by one and then parse them and write the data into the 
database.
